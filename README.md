### Trends

![trends diagram](trend.png)

Both METAR and TAF objects have a list of `trends`.
For the METAR object the `MetarTrend` represents the trend.
For TAF object the trends can be `FMTafTrend`, `TafTrend` and `TafProbTrend`.
It is possible to get a specific type of Trend for TAF with methods:
- getBECMGs
- getFMs
- getProbs
- getTempos
- getInters

Trends inherit from `AbstractWeatherContainer` so they have the following fields:
- a wind
- a windshear
- a visibility and vertical visibility
- a list of clouds
- a list of weather conditions
- a Remark

## Airports loading

By default, airports are loaded from the temporary file [airport.dat](metarParser-spi/src/main/resources/data/airports.dat)
It is possible to provide your own source of airports via spi.
See [spi](metarParser-spi/README.md) module for details. 

## Examples

### Parse a metar

Instantiate the metarFacade and use its method parse.

```java
String code = "LFPG 131830Z 19005KT 170V250 9999 -SHRA FEW040TCU SCT086 16/08 Q1011";
MetarService service = MetarService.getInstance();
Metar metar = service.decode(code);
```

### Retrieve the metar of an airport

Instantiate the metarFacade.
Use the MetarService and its method retrieveFromAirport with the ICAO code of the airport.

```java
String icao = "LFPG";
MetarService service = MetarService.getInstance();
Metar metar = service.retrieveFromAirport(icao);
```

### Parse a taf

Use the TAFFacade to decode the taf.

```java
String message = "TAF LFPG 150500Z 1506/1612 17005KT 6000 SCT012 \n" 
                  +"TEMPO 1506/1509 3000 BR BKN006 PROB40 \n"
                  +"TEMPO 1506/1508 0400 BCFG BKN002 PROB40 \n"
                  +"TEMPO 1512/1516 4000 -SHRA FEW030TCU BKN040 \n" 
                  +"BECMG 1520/1522 CAVOK \n"
                  +"TEMPO 1603/1608 3000 BR BKN006 PROB40 \n"
                  +"TEMPO 1604/1607 0400 BCFG BKN002 TX17/1512Z TN07/1605Z";
TAFService service = TAFService.getInstance();
TAF taf = service.decode(message);
```

Lines of the message have to be separated by a "\\n" character.

### Retrieve a taf

Use the TAFFacade and the method retrieveFromAirport with the ICAO code of the airport.

```java
String icao = "LFPG";
TAFService service = TAFService.getInstance();
TAF taf = service.retrieveFromAirport(icao);
```

### Internationalization

The default locale is english.
The following locales are also available in the project but may not be fully translated:
- French
- German
- Italian
- Polish
- Russian
- simplified chinese
- Spanish
- Turkish

#### Change the locale and contributing

To change the locale use the method `setLocale(Locale)` of the class `Messages.java`

```(java)
Messages.getInstance().setLocale(Locale.FRENCH); // Changes the locale to french.
```

If you are willing to add a new locale or contribute to the project please see [Contributing.md file](CONTRIBUTING.md).
